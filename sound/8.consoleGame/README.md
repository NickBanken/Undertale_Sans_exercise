## Welcome mortals
After all your hard work, I think its time to do something fun!
Since Halloween is almost up, let's stick with the theme...

We are going to create a small console game.
Nothing toooo "BIG", just think straight and you will do just fine...
As you can see there is a small template that you have to use.
In there you will find our friend **Sans**.

Sans will be your training dummy, you will have to create a system in which you can fight the poor soul.


## Exercise

Use functions/methods in the console.log to make moves. All responses should be displayed in the log as well!

1. Create 2 objects in which you will store the following:
- Race
- Type
- Moves
- Health

1. Disable the song by making the `music:on` functional.

1. Everyone has one turn at a time. Who starts is up to you.

1. Both objects can heal, the player can heal between 8-20 HP, Sans between 40-80 HP;

1. Both objects can attack, the player deals between 20-120 damage and sans 10-15 damage.

1. Both have a critical strike chance of 1/4. (Doubles the damage).

1. After each move by the player, Sans should say a pun, do this by calling the `randomPun(puns)` function.

1. After each move by the player, Sans should make a move, but give him a tiny delay, he should not make a move directly.

1. After each move display the important stats that we need to be aware of. If the player heals, show how much he/she healed and at what hp level the player is.

1. The health info of the player should have a red color, Sans his health should be blue.

1. When the player heals over 100 hp, make sans do the `randomPun(overHealReaction)` function.

1. When someone drops below 1 health, the game should end.

1. Make a function retry, that only works if the game has ended.

1. Each move should have a sound effect. The provided effects are in the to folder `resources/sound`.

## Bonus

It does not end here! Make the game even better until the deadline is reached! Have fun!
